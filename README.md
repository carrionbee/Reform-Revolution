# Reform & Revolution
Reform &amp; Revolution mod for Victoria 3

**Hello 1.5!**

*New features! Corportatist Labour Syndicates! LGBTQ Rights Laws! Technocratic Dirigisme! Character Interactions! (with more to come!) Discreet Powers! Converting Ideologies! and more!*

~~is funni to see integralism in the base game now. it works with our urban ownership laws. hehe~~

This mod started as an **expansion** of the original scope of "Centralized Law Pack". 
Now with new Ownership Methods! Redesigned and NEW laws! Ideologies! Decrees! **Queer Rights Compatibility!** Working Hours Compatibility! Environmental Regulations Compatibility!


__**LOAD ORDER:**__  
Place this mod at the bottom of the load order.  My main design pillar of this mod in one (1) word: Harmonization. This is to say: I want this mod to be highly compatible with other mods, and ensure features play nice with many mods. 
Yes, that does mean for example: putting this mod below Better Politics Mod in load order. Do let me know if you notice anything strange, I play with that mod as well. That mod in particular is the highest priority for mod compatibility - besides Theresia's Communist Overhaul. (my beloved).
Speaking of BPM: The Beta version is **not** harmonised  Reform & Revolution as of yet.

__**REQUIRED & RECOMMENDED ITEMS:**__  
  • Theresia's Communist Overhaul: **Borderline Essential**  
Designed with that mod in mind, and is my deepest preference.  
  • 'Laws +' & 'Working Hours': **Highly Recommended** 
I made those mod's contents compatibile with mine, harmonised, curated, and updated for the current version explicitly! If you want that content, subscribe to them! <3
  • Assassination & Espionage: **Recommended, but Optional** 
Required for the CHARACTER INTERACTION: Neutralise Target. (I prefer to give credit to the OG mod in this way, so if people like this, they can subscribe to the OG and use the character interaction implementation from my mod. The other ideological character interactions are stand-alone for my mod).
  • Emergency Laws: **Recommended, but Optional** 
Need Reserve Powers or Autocracy in order to activate the decision.
  • Emergency Election: **Recommended, but Optional** 
Need Reserve Powers in order to activate the decision.

**The modifications consist of:**

• Character Interactions! (with more to come!) Discreet Powers! Converting Ideologies! and more!
• Rebalancing of economic laws so that Urban Planning and Rural Planning can be used with Economic System laws.
• New Laws! The redesigned Urban Planning and the Rural Development Law Groups expand the degree of economic control and customisation of the state. As well as the Centralization Law Group to further define the Authority of the state.
• New Production Methods! [!] Will your urban economy come under the sway of the rising bourgeois classes? Or will you find a way to keep them under the thumb of the State...or perhaps the Church?

• Harmonisation of Interest Group approval and disapproval. 
• Harmonisation and compatibility with 'Null & Void' [strike]Occultists may have opinions.[/strike]
• Harmonisation and compatibility with 'Private Construction Industry'
• Harmonisation and compatibility with 'Heart of Appalachia, An Atompunk Mod'
• Harmonisation and compatibility with 'Laws +'
• Harmonisation, compatibility [b]and[/b] expansion of 'Working' Hours' Mod

I hope to expand this mod over time, and if you have feedback please do comment!
