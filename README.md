# Reform & Revolution
Reform &amp; Revolution mod for Victoria 3

### Reform & Revolution update for 1.5.10 will be releasing on the 3rd of December 12:30 UTC

**Hello 1.5!**

*New features! Corportatist Labour Syndicates! LGBTQ Rights Laws! Technocratic Dirigisme! Character Interactions! (with more to come!) Discreet Powers! Converting Ideologies! and more!*

~~is funni to see integralism in the base game now. it works with our urban ownership laws. hehe~~

This mod started as an **expansion** of the original scope of "Centralized Law Pack". 
Now with new Ownership Methods! Redesigned and NEW laws! Ideologies! Decrees! **Queer Rights Compatibility!** Working Hours Compatibility! Environmental Regulations Compatibility!


__**LOAD ORDER:**__  
Place this mod at the bottom of the load order.  My main design pillar of this mod in one (1) word: Harmonization. This is to say: I want this mod to be highly compatible with other mods, and ensure features play nice with many mods. 
Yes, that does mean for example: putting this mod below Better Politics Mod in load order. Do let me know if you notice anything strange, I play with that mod as well. That mod in particular is the highest priority for mod compatibility - besides Theresia's Communist Overhaul. (my beloved).  
Speaking of BPM: The Beta version is **not** harmonised  Reform & Revolution as of yet.

__**REQUIRED & RECOMMENDED ITEMS:**__  
**Borderline Essentials:**  
  • *Theresia's Communist Overhaul:* https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2884072470   
Designed with that mod in mind, and is my deepest preference.  
  • *Laws+:* https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2941539986    
I made these mod's contents compatibile with mine, harmonised, curated, and updated for the current version explicitly! If you want that content, subscribe to them! <3  
**Highly Recommened (and much beloved):**  
  • *Queer Rights:* https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3093348783  
    Much beloved. An important struggle for the time and now too. I was actually working on my own implementation of this before when I was told this mod came out! I did harmonise our features, so the law effects will differ a bit!  
  • *Working Hours Laws:* https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2908811278  
    Such an important struggle for the labour unions of the period, let alone in general. I did expand some of the laws; we now have 40 hour weeks, 32 hour weeks, 20 hours weeks. Very progressive. Very prolet avant-garde.  
  • *Environmental Regulations:* https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3066697607  
    Necessary as pollution has effects, and another reason to hate the Industrialists.  
**Recommended, but Optional:**  
  • *Birth Rates Laws:* https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3024374381  
    A wonderful smol mod. My effects harmonisation did make a minor change to what the tax credit does (effects accepted pops only) but a great mod!  
  • *Assassination & Espionage:*  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2885841953  
    One of my first thoughts since PDX added character interactions. This mod is **Required** for the CHARACTER INTERACTION: Neutralise Target. (I prefer to give credit to the OG mod in this way, so if people like this, they can subscribe to the OG and use the character interaction implementation from my mod. The other ideological character interactions are stand-alone for my mod).  
  • *Emergency Laws:* https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2921807355  
  • *Emergency Election:* https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2971877982  
    Very very nice mods, and plays nicely with the newly revised Executive Privleges. You require some form of Executive Privleges to do this, or Autocracy in order to activate the decisions.  

**The modifications consist of:**  
• Character Interactions! (with more to come!) Discreet Powers! Converting Ideologies! and more!  
• Rebalancing of economic laws so that Urban Planning and Rural Planning can be used with Economic System laws.  
• New Laws! The redesigned Urban Planning and the Rural Development Law Groups expand the degree of economic control and customisation of the state. As well as the Centralization Law Group to further define the Authority of the state.  
• New Production Methods! [!] Will your urban economy come under the sway of the rising bourgeois classes? Or will you find a way to keep them under the thumb of the State...or perhaps the Church?  

• Harmonisation of Interest Group approval and disapproval.  
• Harmonisation and compatibility with 'Null & Void' ~~Occultists may have opinions.~~  
• Harmonisation and compatibility with 'Private Construction Industry'  
• Harmonisation and compatibility with 'Heart of Appalachia, An Atompunk Mod'  
• Harmonisation and compatibility with 'Laws +'  
• Harmonisation, compatibility **and** expansion of 'Working' Hours' Mod  

I hope to expand this mod over time, and if you have feedback please do comment!
