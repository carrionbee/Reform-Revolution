 ideology_integralism:0 "Religious Integralism"
 ideology_integralism_desc:0 "Amidst the shifting tides of the 19th and 20th centuries, Integralism emerges a socio-economic ideology seeking to merge old traditions with the modern world. Its followers push for a society where a powerful central authority keeps order guided by morals and religion, not capital. They look to the past for inspiration, wanting to revive old customs. Critics view this synthesis of morality and economy as obscuring the underlying class conflicts inherent in society, that the revival of historical traditions is viewed not as a genuine attempt to create a balanced society - but as a smokescreen masking the continued exploitation of the working class."

 ideology_corporatist_leader_desc:0 "Amidst the shifting tides of the 19th and 20th centuries, Corporatism emerges as a socio-economic ideology seeking to harmonize the interests of labor, capital, and the state within a structured framework. Central to corporatist thought is the belief that society's various components, particularly businesses and workers, should collaborate under the guidance of a centralized authority. This character believes this cooperative approach would foster economic stability and social cohesion. Critics say this class-collaborative framework is a veiled attempt in perpetuating exploitation, and often serves the interests of the bourgeoisie in maintaining their existing power structures and reinforcing the dominance of capital."
