However there are wings of the [GetPopType('officers').GetName] and [GetPopType('soldiers').GetName] that will push for a further consolidation of powers - to ensure peace, freedom, justice, and security for the state."
 
 institution_feudal_privilages:0 "Feudal Oversight"

 law_informal_authority:0 "Informal Authority"
 law_informal_authority_desc:0 "The state capital has nominal authority on the country, but its ability to project that authority effectively ends at the borders of the city center. The hierarchy of power in the rest of the country is completely informal, relying instead on the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]'s ability to identify local leaders and on their willingness to cooperate with their commands."
 
 law_feudalism:0 "Feudalism"
 law_feudalism_desc:0 "Feudalism is a system of devolved governance style where specific individuals are determined the landowners of provinces, all of which are held in personal loyalty to the head of state for the whole nation. A somewhat decentralized model, Feudalism results in strong local governments formed around an aristocracy and greatly strengthens landholder political power. This allows more authoritative actions, but the populace will know who is responsible for poor quality of life"
 
 law_unitary:0 "Unitary"

Each canton organizes itself according to its needs while facilitating compliance to authority. The more governance is styled in accordance to military in response to an external threat, it is not difficult to find internal threats too. Likewise, if standard of living declines under this governance model, what use is the army to protect people when the government can't provide food?"
 
 law_federalism:0 "Federalism"
 law_federalism_desc:0 "Federalism diffuses the power of the central government - often utilizing a system of regional representation to each state, allowing them to conduct internal policy often by using residual powers. Tax income does not always reach the national treasury, as tax funding is often split between national and state bodies - as well as funding initiatives and grants provided by the state. The diffused powers ease administration of population, and the state governments can take care of their internal commerce. This facilitating of connections to markets along with local infastructure eases the burden on the central authority. Consequently, locals tend to feel empowered under this system, and are less keen to seek violent change within the state."
 
 law_confederation:0 "Confederation"
 law_confederation_desc:0 "Confederation is an extremely decentralized system which gives local regions not only autonomous control over economic and political policy, but even a degree of military autonomy through milita organisations. This can be considered as an exagerated diffusion of power compared to federalism - under this system the provinces are nominally united under the central government and coalition-building is commonplace. Participation in provincial militias ensures a sense of community, security and safety."

Neighborhoods are often planned from within, and urban services are provided by strong unions, for better or worse.

 law_sharecropping:0 "Tenant Farming"
 law_sharecropping_desc:0 "The typical form of tenant farming is called sharecropping - in which capitalist investors own the rights to land, and provide this land to local farmers in exchange for a percentage of that farmer's produce. While this system is still exploitative, smalltime farmers may be able to gain wealth through this arrangement, and occasionally use it to buy and develop new farmlands for themselves and their families. Capitalist investors often use this system in order to escape taxes by shifting the burden onto their tenant farmers."
 
 law_smallholders:0 "Smallholders"

 law_LGBTQ_rights_criminalised:0 "Deviancy Laws: Criminalisation & Persecution"
 law_LGBTQ_rights_criminalised_desc:0 "The state has various laws in place that actively criminalise identity and behavior of sexual minorities, from anti-sodomy laws, anti-crossdressing laws, to criminalised same-sex relationships. Harsh punishments are commonplace, discrimination and persecution are unchallenged in this society. Such laws create a hostile environment for these individuals, drowning of their basic human rights and a very real risk to life."
 
 law_LGBTQ_rights_institutionalised:0 "Mandatory Institutionalisation of Sexual Minorities"
 law_LGBTQ_rights_institutionalised_desc:0 "Institutionalisation represents a shift away from overt criminal punishments towards pathologisation of sexual minorities as mentally ill. Individuals may be forcibly detained in psychiatric facilities solely based on sexual orientation or gender identity for so-called treatment. This institutionalised discrimination extends beyond criminal law, as mental health institutions are used to subject sexual minorities to gross abuses under the guise of medical care. Such practices further exacerbate the suffering of sexual minorities, as legal barriers to employment persist and essential services are denied as discrimination persists. Basic human rights and bodily health are routinely violated under pseudoscientific pretexts."

 law_LGBTQ_rights_decriminalised_desc:0 "Decriminalisation represents a shift towards a toleration (but not acceptance) of sexual minorities, where laws no longer explicitly target individuals for prosecution.
